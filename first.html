    <h2> welcome </h2>  
    <p>GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code.<br>
         Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time. <br>
         Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see</p>
